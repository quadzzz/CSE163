    "## DNA Match Score\n",
    "Write a function called `dna_match_score` that takes two strings as arguments that represent DNA sequence alignments and returns the score of the alignment. A string of DNA is a string composed of the characters `\"A\"`, `\"C\"`, `\"G\"`, `\"T\"`, or `\"-\"` to represent a gap in the alignment. The two strings will be the same length. You are guaranteed that the strings will be valid DNA alignments and that there won’t be two `\"-\"` in the same position in both strings. "

    "We will use a simplified score function for alignments than what is actually used in practice. All that is needed to do here is add up the scores for each index in the two strings by comparing the characters that appear at the same index in both strings using the following rules:\n",
    "- If both characters match and are one of `\"A\"`, `\"C\"`, `\"G\"`, `\"T\"`, the score is +2.\n",

    "For example, consider that the sequences given are `\"-ATGC\"` and `\"CATGT\"`.

    "At the 0th index, we are matching with a gap so the score is -2. For indices 1, 2, and 3 the scores are +2 for each index as the character A matches to A, T matches to T, and G matches to G. For index 3, we score this match as a -1 as the letters do not match and neither value is a `\"-\"`. The score for the overall alignment will come from adding the index scores together so we end up with -2 + 2 + 2 + 2 - 1 = 3. "
