    "# Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will introduce fundamental control structures (`if` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops) for Python. By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate expressions involving arithmetic and boolean operators.\n",
    "1. Apply for loops to iterate over a range of numbers increasing/decreasing by a fixed step size.\n",
    "1. Apply while loops to iterate until reaching a desired program condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we learn about control structures, let's learn a bit about the Jupyter Notebook data programming environment that we'll be using throughout this course. Jupyter Notebooks allow you to write formatted text descriptions (**Markdown cells**) alongside runnable Python code (**Code cells**). The text you're reading now is an example of a Markdown cell. You can double-click this text to edit it. Feel free to edit the contents of any cells that we give you: your changes only apply to your own copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you ever need to undo all your changes and start over, go to the file tree on the left, right-click the current notebook, delete the notebook, and open it again from the course website. This grabs a fresh copy of the work without any of your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code cells, like the one that appears below, can be run by clicking on the cell and then using the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è play button at the top to run it. The keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Enter** allows you to run the current cell, which comes in handy if you make some edits to a cell and your fingers are already on your keyboard.\n",

    "Try editing the following cell to replace Kevin with your own name and then run it using the keyboard shortcut."
