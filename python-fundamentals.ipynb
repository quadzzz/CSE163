We won't focus so much on practicing the Python programming we are learning in class so far as we will have plenty of practice in the coming weeks. Instead, we want to focus on the tools and processes you will use while developing Python in JupyterHub since that can make you more efficient when solving problems in this class.\n",

This lets you work anywhere from any computer, and your data is constantly backed-up online. However, if you prefer to store and run all your programs on your own computer, this course uses common data science packages for Python that you can optionally [install via Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)."

    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch the debugger, in the top right corner of the interface, look for the **Enable Debugger** 🐞 (beetle or bug) icon. Clicking this icon causes two things to happen: the debugger panel will open on the right side of the screen to show the current state of the Python environment, and each code cell will widen slightly to make space for line numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the debugger, we have to add a **breakpoint**, a signal that is used to tell Python where to pause the program for inspection. Add a breakpoint to the `fizz_buzz` program above by moving your cursor over the line number 6 and clicking when a faint red dot appears. The shaded red dot that appears represents the breakpoint that we just added to line 6, which tells Python to pause the program just prior to running line 6. Use `Shift+Enter` to re-run the code cell above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, instead of printing all the output below, the program is paused before it has the chance to print the first `Buzz` on line 6. To the right, the current **variables** are shown at the top of the debugger panel: `i: 5` and `n: 20`. The **callstack** panel tells us that we're currently inspecting the `fizz_buzz` function and shows controls to ▶ continue running until the next breakpoint, ■ stop the current program, ⤼ step over to the next instruction, and two more options for stepping into a function call or out of the current function call. Try ⤼ stepping over a few times before using the ▶ continue button to run until the next breakpoint (or the end of the program).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've learned a bit about the debugger, edit the `fizz_buzz` method so that it produces the desired output. The staff solution adds 2 lines of code and edits 1 existing line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can use print statements and the debugger to help us investigate bugs, these approaches require us to identify that there's a bug in the first place. When you write data programs for your own personal use, it is often sufficient to manually identify bugs and address them accordingly. But when you write data programs for others or as part of a team project, manually identifying bugs can lead to brittle code that is hard to maintain and validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger your data programs grows, the harder it is to reason about all the parts at once. It gets even harder when some modules (parts of a program) are written by one person while other modules are written by another person---if a bug appears, how do we know whether it's this module or the other module that's causing the problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing** provides a way to automate bug detection and ensure that future changes do not break existing code. We'll start by learning about **doctests** (documentation tests), a Python-specific way to quickly get started with writing test cases without getting bogged down in details. A doctest is code defined at the top of a function and surrounded by triple quotes: `\"\"\"` or `'''`."
