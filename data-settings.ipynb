They further show how research data acquired from those sources are shaped by sampling because companies like Reddit and Instagram employ proprietary methods to deliver their data to researchers, and those methods are never disclosed. Related research by Devin Gaffney and J. Nathan Matias took on a popular corpus that claimed to contain \"every publicly available Reddit comment.\" Their work showed the that the supposedly complete corpus is missing at least thirty-six million comments and twenty-eight million submissions.\n",

The title *appears* to be neutral and free of bias. This is a graphic about rates of mental illness diagnosis of incarcerated people broken down by race and ethnicity. The people are referred to as *inmates*, the language that the study used. The title does not mention race or ethnicity, or racism or health inequities, nor does the title point to what the data mean. But this is where additional questions about context come in. Are you representing only the four numbers that we see in the chart? Or are you representing the context from which they emerged?\n",

The first chart does not simply fail to communicate that but also actively undermines that main finding of the research. Moreover, the language used to refer to people in jail as *inmates* is dehumanizing, particularly in the context of the epidemic of mass incarceration in the United States. So, consider the second chart: Racism in Jail: People of Color Less Likely to Get Mental Health Diagnosis. This title offers a frame for how to interpret the numbers along the lines of the study from which they emerged. The research study was about racial disparities, so the title and content of this chart are about racial disparities. The people behind the numbers are *people*, not *inmates*. In addition, and crucially, the second chart names the forces of oppression that are at work: racism in prison.\n",
