    "In this assessment, you'll implement and test a variety of unrelated functions to demonstrate your ability to apply control structures and data structures to solve problems involving numbers, text, and files. There's no realistic data science motivation or context for this assignment: it's just a grab-bag of questions. Future assessments will have more context.\n",

    "For each question, you'll be asked to write a function and test it. We've provided several input-output examples for each function. To fulfill testing requirements, convert each provided example into a doctest and **additionally write 2 more test cases of your own**. Be ready to justify and explain the design of all your work: how and why did you write each line of code?\n",
