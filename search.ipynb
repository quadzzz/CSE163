    "# Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment, you'll implement a basic search engine by defining your own Python classes. A **search engine** is an algorithm that takes a query and retrieves the most relevant documents for that query. In order to identify the most relevant documents, our search engine will use **term frequency–inverse document frequency** ([tf–idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)), an information statistic for determining the relevance of a term to each document from a corpus consisting of many documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf–idf statistic consists of two components: term frequency and inverse document frequency. **Term frequency** computes the number of times that a term appears in a **document** (such as a single Wikipedia page). If we were to use only the term frequency in determining the relevance of a term to each document, then our search result might not be helpful since most documents contain many common words such as \"the\" or \"a\". In order to downweight these common terms, the **document frequency** computes the number of times that a term appears across the **corpus** of all documents. The **tf–idf** statistic takes a term and a document and returns the term frequency divided by the document frequency."

In order to implement `term_frequency` later, we'll need to precompute and save the term frequency for each term in the document in the initializer as a field by constructing a dictionary that maps each `str` term to its `float` term frequency. Term frequency is defined as *the count of the given term* divided by *the total number of words in the text*.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. A method `term_frequency` that takes a given `str` term and returns its term frequency by looking it up in the precomputed dictionary. Remember to normalize the term before looking it up to find the corresponding match. If the term does not occur, return 0.\n",

    "1. A method `get_words` that returns a `set` of the unique, cleaned words in this document.\n",

The `__repr__` method is called when Jupyter Notebook needs to display a `Document` as output, so we should be able to copy the string contents into a new code cell and immediately run it to create a new `Document`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each of the 4 methods (excluding the initializer) in the `Document` class, write a testing function that contains at least 3 `pytest`-style assertions based on your own testing corpus**. Documentation strings are optional for testing functions.\n",
