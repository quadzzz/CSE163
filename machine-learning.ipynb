    "In this lesson, we'll introduce machine learning from the ground up. By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe the difference between traditional algorithms and machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- Identify the components of a machine learning model and dataset features and labels.\n",
    "- Apply `sklearn` to train a decision tree for classification and regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while back, we discussed data visualization using the [Puget Sound Clean Air Agency's](https://pscleanair.gov/) EPA-grade air quality sensors (**AQS**). However, these sensors are typically expensive, costing anywhere between \\\\$15,000 and \\\\$40,000 each, making it hard to deploy a large number of these sensors. Furthermore, EPA-grade AQS measurements also undergo calibration and accuracy checks that lead to delays of one or two hours, leading to data that is very accurate but not necessarily timely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, \"[PurpleAir](https://www2.purpleair.com/) makes sensors that empower Community Scientists who collect hyper-local air quality data and share it with the public.\" In this lesson, we'll learn how we can use more accurate but less timely AQS measurements to calibrate the less accurate but more timely PurpleAir sensor (**PAS**) measurements so that we can provide the best information to the general public. The concepts in this lesson are actually used in the real world when you visit the EPA [AirNow Fire and Smoke Map](https://fire.airnow.gov/): the PAS data in this map are calibrated using the approach we will learn today."
