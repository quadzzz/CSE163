The one situation where they are not a good choice is when you need to make a complex, standalone figure that composes multiple different plot kinds. At this point, it’s recommended to set up the figure using matplotlib directly and to fill in the individual components using axes-level functions."

The effectiveness of any particular graph is not just a matter of how it looks in the abstract, but also a question of who is looking at it, and why.

The graph reads as though people were asked to say whether they thought it was essential to live in a democracy, and the results plotted show the percentage of respondents who said \"Yes\", presumably in contrast to those who said \"No\". But in fact the survey question asked respondents to rate the importance of living in a democracy on a ten point scale, with 1 being \"Not at all Important\" and 10 being \"Absolutely Important\". The graph showed the difference across ages of people who had given a score of \"10\" only, not changes in the average score on the question. As it turns out, while there is some variation by year of birth, most people in these countries tend to rate the importance of living in a democracy very highly, even if they do not all score it as \"Absolutely Important\".
