    "# Strings and Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll introduce strings and lists in Python. We'll also learn the principles of documenting code. By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Evaluate expressions involving strings, string slicing, and lists.\n",
    "-   Apply `str` operations and slicing to compute a new string representing the desired text.\n",
    "-   Apply `list` operations to store, retrieve, and modify values in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## String indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** are commonly used to represent text. In Python, `str` (pronounced \"stir\") represents a string. We'll refer to **string** and `str` interchangeably since we're focusing on Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `str` values are defined by surrounding text in matching quotes: either a `'` or a `\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Which quotation mark you use is a matter of personal preference: choose one and try to be consistent. It's acceptable to deviate from your preferred style when you want to work with a string that contains a character like `'` (e.g. the `str` `\"you won't\"`). In that case, it would not work to define a `str` like `'you won't'` since Python would read the apostrophe as the closing of the string. So we'd prefer `\"` here to avoid the conflicting interpretation of `'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The characters in a string are accessible by index starting from 0 and incrementing up to the length of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "| h | e | l | l | o |   | w | o | r | l |  d |\n",
    "|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|\n",
    "| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a character at a specific index, use the `s[i]` notation to get a particular character from a string `s`."
