    "In response to the 2008 U.S. Farm Bill, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's [Economic Research Service](https://www.ers.usda.gov/about-ers/) compiled a [June 2009 report to Congress](https://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/pub-details/?pubid=42729):\n",
    "\n",
    "> According to data from the latest census (2000), about 23.5 million people, or 8.4 percent of the U.S. population, live in low-income neighborhoods that are more than a mile from a supermarket. Low-income neighborhoods are areas where more than 40 percent of the population has income less than or equal to 200 percent of the Federal poverty threshold ($44,000 per year for a family of four in 2008).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assessment, we'll simulate their analysis by creating geospatial maps to help us understand food access in Washington. There are three geographic region types that we'll use in this assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Census tract** is a geographic region used in the U.S. census. It is the smallest of the three region types.\n",
    "- **County** is a geographic region used for administrative purposes that can include one or more census tracts.\n",
    "- **State** is a geographic region such as the State of Washington. It is the largest of the three region types.\n",
    "\n",
    "A census tract is defined as **low access** if enough people in the tract do not have nearby access to grocery stores offering affordable and nutritious food. In urban areas, \"low access\" is defined as 0.5 miles; in rural areas, \"low access\" is defined as 10 miles.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tl_2010_53_tract00.shp` contains the 2010 US census dataset in geospatial shapefile format only for Washington state (53). The only columns you need to use are `CTIDFP00`, the census tract identifier, and `geometry`, the geometric shape of the tract.\n",
    "\n",
    "`food_access.csv` contains the food access dataset in tabular CSV format. Each row in the dataset corresponds to a census tract for every state in the country (not just Washington). This dataset has many columns but you only need to understand the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CensusTract` is the census tract identifier.\n",
    "- `State` is the state name for the census tract.\n",
    "- `County` is the county name for the census tract.\n",
    "- `Urban` is a flag (0 or 1) that indicates if this census tract is an urban environment.\n",
    "- `Rural` is a flag that indicates if this census tract is a rural environment.\n",
    "- `LATracts_half` is a flag that indicates if this census tract is \"low access\" in a half mile radius.\n",
    "- `LATracts10` is a flag that indicates if this census tract is \"low access\" in a 10 mile radius.\n",
    "- `LowIncomeTracts` is a flag that indicates if this census tract is \"low income\".\n",
    "- `POP2010` is the number of people in this census tract according to the 2010 census.\n",
    "- `lapophalf` is the number of people in this census tract considered having \"low access\" in a half mile radius.\n",
    "- `lapop10` is the number of people in this census tract considered having \"low access\" in a 10 mile radius.\n",
    "- `lalowihalf` is similar to `lapophalf` but only counts people considered low access and low income.\n",
    "- `lalowi10` is similar to `lapop10` but only counts people considered low access and low income."
